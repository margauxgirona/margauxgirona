*Hello* :grinning: <br/>   
My name is Margaux Girona I am from france :baguette_bread:    
I am in korea because I choose to do my exchange semester in this country. I really love its culture and of course the food too. <br/>        
I am an ingeneering student of [**ESILV**](https://www.esilv.fr/). I am the captain of the rowing association :rowboat:, actually this means that I am the coach. I love to play chess too :chess_pawn:. And I think that's all for me :hugs:.
